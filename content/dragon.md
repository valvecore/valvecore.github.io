<h2> My Hydra Past Life </h2>

{{< /rawhtml >}}

- I had a hydra past life, with three heads, 6 arms and two tails. The form was humanoid/anthropomorphic and what some people may call 
an abyss/voidling. I was born in the void, we where seperate souls that decided to fuse together to protect ourselfs from the void. I am the 
head in the middle

<h2> My Fire Dragon Past Life ( ohdvalez )</h2>

{{< /rawhtml >}}

- I had a past life as a orange fire dragon, it was extremely tragic. I only lived about 2-3 weeks before i died from drowning in my own blood.
I met my father and some of my family from that life in my current one. They are assholes and narcissistic
